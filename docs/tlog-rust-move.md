# Transparency Logs

Golang recently got code transparency (see [Go-tlog], [tlog]).

(Note that Trillian is itself implemented in Golang.)

# Rust

A [Rust API for Trillian] will be nice to have. Once we have that we can secure the Rust/crates.io ecosystem better.

We're planning to build this API ourselves even though it's not in our immediate roadmap. Want to contribute? Contact us on [Discord]!

# Move

Wouldn't it be nice to have [Transparency logs for All PLs]? We believe Move should have it too. âˆ†

Once the LC authors deliver on their [plan] of a *versioning scheme for Move*, we may integrate it with our ongoing work on `cargo-move` and `cargo-movemint`.
